            <p>
                Scatter is a decentralized IPFS pinning service built on Ethereum. If you want to keep
                files on IPFS but don't want to permanently keep a node running to pin your files, you
                can offer to pay others a small fee to do it for you.
            </p>
            <p>
                Scatter consists of two key participants.  The <a href="#def-bidder">bidder</a>,
                and the <a href="#def-validator">pinner</a>.  Each one plays their part to keep a
                healthy network.

                    The bidder is the participant who needs a file pinned. They use the dapp and
                    their local IPFS node to add their file and make a bid for a hoster to pin
                    their file. They don't need to permanently keep their IPFS node up, just long
                    enough for the hoster to get and pin their file.

                    The pinner is the participant that will actually be pinning the file. They run

                    a permanent IPFS node to pin the bidders' files.  For every file, there are two
                    pinners.

            <h2>Challenges</h2>

            <h3>Proving files have been pinned</h3>
            <p>
                Listing IPFS pins of a remote node requires API access. The IPFS HTTP API was not
                built with access control and security in mind. Leaving the API open allows anyone
                to add or remove files, pins, and perform other operations that really shouldn't be
                public.
            </p>
            <p>
                To add to the fun, these API calls can be spoofed or falsified pretty easily. A
                malicious hoster could accept bids, and setup an API that responds showing that pins
                were made when in fact nothing is actually there.  This is a lot of effort to go
                through just to pretend to be actually hosting files, but would be a successful
                attack that would lower the qulity of the network.  This option has more or less
                been ruled out, but may be an aditional layer of proof in the future when
                <a href="https://github.com/ipfs/notes/issues/159">
                    access control is implemented
                </a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Instead, the primary form of validation is through "Mutually Assured Destruction."
                If the two file pinners can not come to an agreement, both of their initial stakes
                that they put up before pinning the file are burned.  This agreement requires
                each participant to hash two pseudo-random (but repeatable) parts of the file,
                provide half of each to the contract, and each pinner signs one.  If the hashes
                can't be reassembled and the signatures verified by the contract, the "challenge"
                is considered failed.
            </p>
            <p>
                This does leave a known hole in the process.  A pinner could in theory, keep a file
                around just to hash and not offer it to the public IPFS network.  The bandwidth
                savings is likely to be trivial compared to storage, so it's not likely to be overly
                abused.  That said, it is a flaw in the proof that needs to be monitored.
            </p>

                <a href="https://github.com/mikeshultz/scatter-contracts/blob/sans-validators/docs/protocol.md">
                    protocol white paper
                </a>.  This document is continuously being updated as the protocl is refined.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Collusion</h3>
            <p>
                Since the amount of pinners per file are currently fixed at 2, that leaves a
                relatively small window for individuals to try and get two of their pinner accounts
                to stake at the same time by sending out their transactions at the same time.  This
                would allow them full control, acting as both pinners and validating each other.
                They could either only host/pin one copy of the file, or use completely made up file
                hashes for the challenge/defense validation protocol.
            </p>
            <p>
                This can be made somewhat more difficult by <a href="https://github.com/mikeshultz/scatter-contracts/issues/3">
                preventing stakes from landing on the same block</a>. But it is not a full-proof
                method of preventing collusion.
            </p>
            <p>
                It might be best to provide a pinner with the option of using a variable amount of
                pinners, leaving them to determine their own level of risk.  But this adds a lot of
                complexity and will be left out of v1 of Scatter.
